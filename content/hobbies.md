When I'm not coding or building things, you can usually find me throwing discs, climbing rocks, or sliding down mountains!* 🏃‍♂️🧗‍♂️🏂

### Rock Climbing 

I started climbing at <a href="https://recwell.wisc.edu/locations/climbing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mount Mendota</a> and spent a few months climbing at <a href="https://www.blochaven.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlocHaven</a> while in South Carolina (their coffee shop is amazing btw). These days you can find me at <a href="https://www.bouldersgym.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boulders</a> working on v3-4s and pretending I know what beta means.

### Snowboarding

I started riding with <a href="https://www.hoofersns.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoofers</a> in college. Made it out to Winter Park and Copper Mountain a few times, where I discovered that Colorado's "green" runs are Wisconsin's "black diamonds" (who knew?).

When it's not snowing, I teach sailing at <a href="https://www.hoofersailing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoofers</a>. Nothing beats a summer day on Lake Mendota!

### Ultimate Frisbee

This is where most of my bruises come from! I started playing at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madisonwestultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison West HS</a>, where I learned that running is more fun when you're chasing plastic. 

Played for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hodaglove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wisconsin Hodags</a> in college - some of my best memories are from tournaments with those folks. Was honored to be nominated for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsmigKE2v9U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Callahan Award</a> in 2023.

These days I play for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madisonradicals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Radicals</a>, where I get to dive around in front of actual fans! Still can't believe people pay to watch us throw frisbees around.

**Currently accepting suggestions for more hobbies that involve throwing myself through the air* 🚀
